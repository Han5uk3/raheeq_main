    // Freshchat hooks below never ran at all: an agent's reply reached the
    // device as a push but never reached the SDK, leaving an open
    // conversation to pick it up only on its own sync when reopened.
    //
    // Registering first means firebase_messaging leaves us in place and still
    // receives every callback through the plugin chain that `super` fans out
    // to, so Messaging#onMessage and the local-notification path are unchanged.

    // and a permission_handler prompt, so the token arrived seconds into the
    // session -- sometimes after `Freshchat.init`, sometimes long before it.

    // Coverage: `requestPermission` only registers when the user *grants*
    // alerts. Registration is independent of that authorisation -- a device
    // that has refused banners still gets a token and still receives the
    // silent `content-available` pushes Freshchat syncs conversations with. A
    // user who declined notifications was previously left with no token at
    // all, so Freshchat had nowhere to push for the whole install and the chat
    // fell back on the SDK's own slow sync permanently.

  // The Dart side registers the FCM token with Freshchat, which is the Android
  // path — the plugin's iOS `setPushRegistrationToken` wants the raw APNs
  // token, and only the app delegate ever sees that. Without these hooks
  // Freshchat has nowhere to push to and no way to hear about a message that
  // did arrive, so an open conversation only picked new messages up on the
  // SDK's own sync when the screen was reopened.
  //
  // Nothing on the Dart side can stand in for them. `NotificationService`
  // forwards Freshchat payloads out of `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage` and the
  // background handler, but firebase_messaging only raises those for payloads
  // carrying `gcm.message_id`, and Freshchat's iOS pushes are sent straight to
  // APNs with the p8 key rather than through FCM — so on iOS that forwarding
  // never runs and these hooks are the only route into the SDK.
  //
  // Every branch either forwards to Freshchat or falls through to `super`, so
  // the app's own notifications keep reaching firebase_messaging and
  // flutter_local_notifications exactly as before.
