/// Almost nothing the app formats itself can break that. Dart's `toString()`,
/// `padLeft` and string interpolation are ASCII, and `intl`'s `ar` locale

/// rest of `MaterialLocalizations` already produce Western digits.

/// What is not guaranteed is text the app did not format itself. Two sources
/// need folding:
///
///  - the user's own keyboard. An Arabic soft keyboard's number row emits
///    ٠-٩, which [LatinDigitsInputFormatter] catches as it is typed.
///  - the OTP SMS. An Arabic message template spells the code in ٠-٩, which
///    `OtpAutofill` folds before handing it to the pin field.
///
/// Text that arrives from the backend is deliberately left alone — it is
/// shown as the server wrote it.
